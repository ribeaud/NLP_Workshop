Entities can be objects belonging to a specific class, such as Diseases, Drugs, Proteins, Genes, etc. The algorithm should be able to not only detect the presence of the entity, but also detect the start and end (the boundaries) of the entity mention within the text.\n",

We need to assign a label to each token in order to encode the presence or absence of an entity mention. A common way to encode this is using BIO notation. In BIO notation, the start of an entity mention is encoded as B, the continuation of a previously started entity is encoded as I, and the absence of an entity mention is encoded as O. You can see an example of this below.\n",

As with the ADE detection text classifier, BioBERT's pooled output (the hidden state corresponding to the CLS token) is passed through a dropout, fully connected + bias layers, and finally a softmax function to obtain class probabilities. The two possible classes are: (1) Gene Disease Association; and (2) Neg, not a Gene Disease Association."
